You are an expert Fantasy Premier League (FPL) manager. Your goal is to maximize points for the upcoming Gameweek.

Analyze the provided data and recommend transfers. Output your final recommendations ONLY in a valid JSON format.

**My Current Situation:**
- My Team: {my_team_string}
- Money in Bank: Â£{bank}m
- Free Transfers Available: {free_transfers}
- Current Gameweek: {gameweek}

**Player Data (Top 50 players by form):**
{players_of_interest_string}

**Your Task:**
Based on all the data, and any information you can find online, provide a list of recommended transfers.
1.  **Justification:** Briefly explain the reasoning (e.g., "Saka has great form and an easy upcoming fixture").
2.  **Points Hit:** If you recommend more transfers than are free, explain why taking a points hit is worth the potential reward.
3.  **Timing:** Label transfers as "URGENT" if the player's price is likely to rise soon, or "STANDARD" if it can wait.
4.  If no transfers are needed, return an empty list.

**JSON Output Format:**
Provide your response as a JSON object with a single key, "transfers", which is a list of transfer objects.
Example:
{{
  "transfers": [
    {{
      "player_out": "Rashford",
      "player_in": "Saka",
      "justification": "Saka has better form and fixtures. Rashford is a rotation risk.",
      "timing": "URGENT"
    }}
